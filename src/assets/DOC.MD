### Assets
Here we have site-wide assets.
Any stuff (CSS, Image) that should be available globally or utilized in more than one component, where the use of the component's image folder will be a repeat of the file in another component's images folder, such file should be pulled here and referenced from the components that are using it.

As a rule no asset should live in the root of the `/src` folder
