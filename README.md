# Create React App Rewired Antd Less

Want to use _AntD_, _react-router_, _react-redux_ and do some more configurations to
create-react-app without ejecting?

**Check in here.**

This boiler plate follows a strict convention for folder structuring inspired by
[Complete guide to structuring large react + redux apps.](https://medium.com/@dominik.t/complete-guide-to-structuring-large-react-redux-apps-bc91e2136d4c);

I find it concise and added some more rules. Check DOC.MD of each sub dir or `/src` to see the usage and what should be contained in the directory.

To do some customization to the antd default variables, update `antd.theme.overrides` to what ever value you want, and restart the server.

### What is included:

- Create React App
- React Router
- Create React App Rewired
- Rewire Create React App Less
- Rewire Create React App Hot Reload
- Antd React UI Component Library
- Styled Components
- Redux Thunk Middleware
